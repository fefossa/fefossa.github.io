description: I am a Ph.D. researcher in Cellular Biology and Computational Biology with 4+ years experience with molecular and cellular biology techniques and computational methods to solve biological problems. I have utilized cell culture and mechanistic assays (cell migration, proliferation, DNA damage) combinedwith fluorescence microscopy and repurposing of dyes to discover and screen for biological effects. I am interested in quantitative image analysis applied to large datasets to find disease-related profiles and applying my skills to optimize the development of new therapies for diseases.---
